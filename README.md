# Prestons-workday-scheduler

here we have a work day scheduler. This web app will help you plan your day and save tasks so you can look at them later.
it is color coordinated to show which hours have already passed and displays the current time and date.
has two buttons a save button to save it into local storage. and a trash button to clear your saved data.
unfortunatly I wasnt able to get it to display the saved data on the main page but with help I was able to get the saved data to show up in the application tab in chrome dev tools.

below is a screen shot of my application. all the tabs are greyed out because i took the screen shot past 5pm.
